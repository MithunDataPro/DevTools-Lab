# Function:
A Function is Block of Reusable Code.

```cpp
// functions = A Block Of Reusable Code

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void mithundama () {
    cout << "He is Great Man" << "\n";
    cout << "He is Greatest of all time" << "\n";
    cout << "He is a real legend" << "\n";
    cout << "He is Great Man" << "\n";
    cout << "He is Great Man" << "\n\n";

}

int main() {
    mithundama();
    mithundama();
    mithundama();
    mithundama();
    return 0;
}

```
## Function by Reading data from other function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void election(string state);


int main() {
    string state = "Andhra Pradesh";

    election(state);

    return 0;

}

void election(string state){  // We need to define data type with its name to read data from other function.
    int age;
    char sex;

    cout << "What is your age: ";
    cin >> age;
    
    cout << "What is Your Sex: ";
    cin >> sex;

    if(age >= 18 && age <= 99 && (sex == 'M' || sex == 'm')) {
        cout << "You are Male and you are elgible to vote in " <<state  <<"\n";
    }
    else if(age >=18 && age <=99 && (sex == 'F' || sex == 'f')){
        cout << "You are a Female and You are Elgible to vote in " <<state <<"\n";
    }
    else if(age >=100){
        cout << "Your age is too high to vote in " <<state <<"\n";
    }
    else{
        cout <<"you are not elgible to vote in " <<state <<"\n";
    }
}

```
# Return Functions:

```cpp
// return keyword:
// return = return a value back to the spot where you called
//          the encompassing function.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Now lets find circumferance of a circle 

double circle(double radius, double pie); // Now we chnaged void to double because of the o/p we need

int main(){   // this is our main function

    double radius;
    double pie;
    cout << "Enter the Radius: ";
    cin >> radius;

    cout << "Enter the value of Pie: ";
    cin >> pie;

    double result = circle(radius, pie);

    cout << "Circumference of a circle is: " << circle << " Units";

    return 0;

}

double circle(double radius, double pie){
    return 2 * pie * radius;
}

```

## What is Function Overloading?
Function overloading allows us to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. The compiler decides which function to call based on the number or type of arguments.

**âœ… Why use function overloading?**
- To make the code cleaner and easier to read.
- To perform similar operations with different data types or different numbers of parameters.



```cpp
// Overloaded Functions:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function Decoration
void lunch();
void lunch(string starter1, string starter2);

int main()
{

lunch("Veg", "Non Veg");
return 0;
}

void lunch() {
    cout << "What Exactly You want me to serve: ";

}
void lunch(string starter1, string starter2){
    cout << "What starter would you like to have " << starter1 << " or " << starter2;

}

```

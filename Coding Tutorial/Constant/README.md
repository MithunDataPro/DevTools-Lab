# 📌 Constants in C++

## 🔹 What is a Constant?
A **constant** in C++ is a variable **whose value cannot be changed** after it has been initialized.  
This ensures that values remain **unchanged** throughout the program, preventing accidental modifications.

## 🔹 How to Declare Constants?

### **1️⃣ Using `const` Keyword**
The **`const`** keyword is used to declare **immutable** variables:
```cpp
const int myNumber = 10;  // Constant integer
const float PI = 3.14159; // Constant float

```

- 🚀 Once assigned, these values cannot be modified!
✅ Best Practice: Constants are written in UPPERCASE for readability.
